# workout-tracker

## Overview:

In this unit, we have covered and implemented the use of MongoDB, a popular noSQL database. Unlike SQL, which is a table-based relational model, this database employs a document-oriented model. Also, in contrast to SQL, noSQL terms include database, collection, document, and field. In addition to MongoDB, we have also covered the use of Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

With this new found expertise, we have been tasked to create fitness tracker. Although the front-end code was provided for this application, it was our responsibility to successfully build the back-end functionality. Upon completion of the app, the reader will find a fitness tracker that that was built with a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

Please find additional information regarding this project below. Thanks.
